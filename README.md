# MiniRenderer
The goal of this project is to learn and understand how do Graphic API's such as OpenGL, DirectX & Vulkan work at a low level.
This project does not rely on external libraries and it will not be working directly with the GPU. The output of the renderer will be found in the file called
'output.tga' because I am not interested in doing it real time for now as it is, as I mentioned earlier, just to learn the basics of rendering at a low-level, painting pixel per pixel :)
