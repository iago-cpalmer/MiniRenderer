# MiniRenderer
The goal of this project is to learn and understand how do Graphic API's such as OpenGL, DirectX & Vulkan work at a low level even though
I will not be working directly with the GPU with no usage of external libraries. The output of the renderer will be found in the file called
'output.tga' because I am not interested in doing it real time for now as it is, as I mentioned earlier, just to learn the basics of rendering at a low-level, painting pixel per pixel :)
